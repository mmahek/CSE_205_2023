/*
Tree has recursive solution
Root Node : Node from which whole tree originated
Leaf Node : Nodes which does not have child
Sibling Nodes : Nodes having same parents
Parent Node : Nodes having further nodes i.e. children
Ancestor Nodes : Nodes who have children who further have children, or say the parent of parent node is called ancestor node
Descendent Nodes : Children of child nodes are called descendent nodes

    - A tree has n nodes then it will have (n-1) edges.
    - Depth : of a node is defined as the total length of path from root to the node OR Number of edges in the path from roots to n.
    - Height : It is the longest path which is avilable or say possible for reaching a node OR Number of edges in the longest path from x to leaf node.
    NOTE* - Height of tree == height of root node.
    - Once node changed, cannot switch to previous node(parent node)

/*
    - Binary Tree - a tree with each node have at most 2 children i.e. it can have 0, 1 or 2 children.
