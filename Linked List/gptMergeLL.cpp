Certainly, I'll explain each line of the C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
``` - This line includes the C++ Standard Library's `iostream` header, which provides input and output stream functionality, allowing you to use `cout` for output.

```cpp class ListNode
{
public:
    int val;
    ListNode *next;

    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
};
``` - This section defines a class named `ListNode`, which represents a node in a singly - linked list.- `int val;
` declares an integer variable `val` to store the value of the node.- `ListNode *next;
` declares a pointer to another `ListNode` object named `next`, representing the next node in the list.- `ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}` is the constructor for the `ListNode` class. It initializes the `val` with the value `x` and sets `next` to `nullptr` (no next node) when a `ListNode` object is created.

```cpp
ListNode* mergeTwoLists(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2)
{
    ``` - This line defines a function named `mergeTwoLists` that takes two pointers to `ListNode` objects(`l1` and `l2`) as arguments and returns a pointer to a `ListNode`.

```cpp
              ListNode *dummy = new ListNode(0);
    ``` - This line creates a new `ListNode` object named `dummy` with a value of `0`.This dummy node is used as a placeholder and makes it easier to handle the merged linked list.

```cpp
              ListNode *current = dummy;
    ``` - This line declares a pointer to `ListNode` named `current` and initializes it to point to the `dummy` node.

```cpp while (l1 && l2)
    {
        ``` - This line starts a `while` loop that continues as long as both `l1` and `l2` are not `nullptr`, meaning there are nodes in both linked lists to merge.

```cpp if (l1->val < l2->val)
        {
            current->next = l1;
            l1 = l1->next;
        }
        else
        {
            current->next = l2;
            l2 = l2->next;
        }
        ``` - Inside the loop, this code compares the values of the current nodes pointed to by `l1` and `l2`.- If `l1->val` is less than `l2->val`, it means the node from `l1` should come next in the merged list.So, `current->next` is set to `l1`, and `l1` is updated to its next node using `l1 = l1->next`.- If `l1->val` is not less than `l2->val`, the node from `l2` should come next.So, `current->next` is set to `l2`, and `l2` is updated to its next node using `l2 = l2->next`.

```cpp current = current->next;
        ``` - After determining which node should come next in the merged list, the `current` pointer is moved to the newly added node.

```cpp
    }
    ``` - The `while` loop continues until one of the linked lists(`l1` or `l2`) is exhausted.

```cpp if (l1)
    {
        current->next = l1;
    }
    else
    {
        current->next = l2;
    }
    ``` - After the loop, one of the linked lists(`l1` or `l2`) might have remaining nodes.This code appends the remaining nodes to the merged list by setting `current->next` to the remaining portion.

```cpp return dummy->next;
}
``` - Finally, the function returns the `next` pointer of the `dummy` node, which is the head of the merged linked list.

```cpp void printList(ListNode *head)
{
    ``` - This line defines a function named `printList` that takes a pointer to a `ListNode` (`head`)as an argument.This function is used to print the elements of the linked list.

```cpp while (head)
    {
        ``` - This line starts a `while` loop that continues as long as the `head` pointer is not `nullptr`, meaning there are more nodes to print in the linked list.

```cpp
                                                                                                                     std::cout
                                                                                                                 << head->val << " -> ";
        head = head->next;
        ``` - Inside the loop, it prints the value of the current node pointed to by `head` using `std::cout`, followed by " -> ".- Then, it updates the `head` pointer to point to the next node in the linked list(`head = head->next`) to continue printing the next element.

```cpp
    }
    ``` - The loop continues until all elements in the linked list have been printed.

```cpp
                std::cout
        << "nullptr" << std::endl;
    ``` - After printing all elements, it prints "nullptr" to indicate the end of the linked list.

```cpp int main()
    {
        ``` - This line starts the `main` function, which is the entry point of the program.

```cpp
                                                        ListNode *l1 = new ListNode(1);
        l1->next = new ListNode(3);
        l1->next->next = new ListNode(5);

        ListNode *l2 = new ListNode(2);
        l2->next = new ListNode(4);
        l2->next->next = new ListNode(6);
        ``` - Here, two sorted linked lists `l1` and `l2` are created and initialized with values.Each list is a series of linked `ListNode` objects, with each node containing a value and a pointer to the next node.

```cpp ListNode *mergedList = mergeTwoLists(l1, l2);
        ``` - This line calls the `mergeTwoLists` function to merge the two input linked lists `l1` and `l2` and stores the merged list's head in the `mergedList` variable.

```cpp
                    std::cout
            << "Merged List: ";
        printList(mergedList);
        ``` - These lines print the merged linked list by calling the `printList` function and passing the `mergedList` as an argument.

```cpp return 0;
    }
    ``` - Finally, the `main` function returns 0 to indicate successful program execution.
