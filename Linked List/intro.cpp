// Linked lists:
// chain of nodes:
// data(user defined data) + pointer(addresss of  next node)
//singly linked list
// the node whose address is known is caleed head, and thhe further nodes have address of next nodes. the node which has null addrees, is called tail, i.e. last node.
//doublee linked list:
// its node has 3 pointers and 1 data, 1st pointer points towards the previous node and second pointer points towards next node.
//the 2nd pointer of last node points towards  null
//circular linked list
// this is same as singly just the lastnode's pointer points towards the address
